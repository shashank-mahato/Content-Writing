In the 1950s, Audrey Hepburn enthralled audiences with her elegance and grace both on and off-screen. Her classic little black dress in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" remains a symbol of ageless chic, while her fondness for minimal, streamlined shapes continues to influence designers to this day.

In the 1960s, it was all about the mod style of Twiggy, the British model and style icon famed for her pixie hairdo and doe-eyed expression. Her miniskirts and bright patterns typified the swinging sixties and continue to influence fashionistas around the world.

Fast forward to the 1990s, and it's hard to talk about fashion icons without discussing the one and only Princess Diana. From her gorgeous red carpet outfits to her off-duty athleisure looks, Diana's style was always effortlessly stylish and perennially covetable.
